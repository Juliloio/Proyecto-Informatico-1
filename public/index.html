    <h2><center>
 Love of my life, you've hurt me<br>
You've broken my heart and now you leave me<br>
Love of my life, can't you see?<br>
Bring it back, bring it back<br>
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know<br>
What it means to me<br>
<br>
Love of my life, don't leave me<br>
You've stolen my love, you now desert me<br>
Love of my life, can't you see?<br>
Bring it back, bring it back (back)<br>
Don't take it away from me<br>
Because you don't know<br>
What it means to me<br>
<br>
Obrigado<br>
<br>
You will remember<br>
When this is blown over<br>
Everything's all by the way<br>
When I grow older<br>
I will be there at your side to remind you<br>
How I still love you (I still love you)<br>
<br>
I still love you<br>
<br>
Oh, hurry back, hurry back<br>
Don't take it away from me<br>
Because you don't know what it means to me<br>
Love of my life<br>
Love of my life<br>
Ooh, eh (alright)<br>
